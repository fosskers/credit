# Credit

`credit` - A tool for measuring Github repository contributions and the overall
health of a project.

Use `credit` to find out:

- Who has the most Pull Requests merged to a project.
- Who engages in the most discussion in Issues and PRs.
- How long it takes maintainers to respond to and solve Issues.
- How long it takes to get PRs merged.
- If a library would be a safe long-term (i.e. maintained) dependency.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

With an AUR-compatible package manager like
[`aura`](https://github.com/fosskers/aura):

```
sudo aura -A credit-bin
```

### Cargo

```
cargo install credit
```

## Usage

To use `credit`, you'll need a Github [Personal Access
Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `public_repo` permissions. [See
here](https://github.com/fosskers/active#oauth) for an additional example.

> **ðŸ’¡ Note:** `credit` calls the Github API, which has a rate limit of 5,000
> requests per hour. If you use `credit` on too large of a project (5,000+
> combined Issues and Pull Requests), it will use up all your allotted requests
> and yield inaccurate results!
>
> Future developments will allow you to restrict your queries to certain time
> periods.

### Markdown Output

By default, `credit` outputs text to stdout that can be piped into a `.md` file
and displayed as you wish:

```
> credit --token=<token> fosskers/versions

## Caveats

The numbers given by `credit` are not perfect measures of developer productivity
nor maintainer responsiveness. Please use its results in good faith.

Without human eyes to judge a code contribution, its importance can be difficult
to measure. Some PRs are long, but do little. Some PRs are only a single commit,
but save the company. `credit` takes the stance that, over time, with a large
enough sample size, general trends of "who's doing the work" will emerge.
